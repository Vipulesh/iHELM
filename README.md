# iHELM
This is my IoT project for my college course(sem - 2). It is a published paper, so anyone doing any similar project or just want any reference, feel free!

This project incorporates a smart biker helmet which handles real-time monitoring of the biker and informs the relevant authorities if the bikers meets an unfortuante accident.
